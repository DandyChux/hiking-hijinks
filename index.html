        <p>Taylor started Hiking Hijinks to share this portion of her mindfulness practice with her work community. Taylor is passionate about making hiking accesible to as many folks as possible, so <strong>let her know if there is anything keeping you from joining the hikers.</strong> She'd love to hear from you.</p>
